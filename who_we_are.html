					<h1>Our Story</h1>
				</div>

				<div class = "ourstory"> While working with the Seongnam Migrants Center we were exposed to many cases of migrant industrial workers experiencing severe injuries from working in factories. In addition to the injuries caused by old and outdated machinery, the companies that hired these injured workers would refuse to provide their workers with compensation. The responsibility for compensation is something that exists whether the migrant workers used legal or illegal means to enter the country. The fact that there were people losing fingers and limbs but not receiving proper compensation is an injustice that needs to be known by the public.  As students, it is difficult for us to take direct legal action. Thus, we want to do everything we can as students to raise awareness of how companies in Korea are violating the rights of many workers.

				<div class = "ourstory1"> We are a group of passionate students who currently provide English teaching services to the Seongnam Migrants Center. In addition to teaching English to interracial families, we also work on projects that tackle issues brought to our attention while working side by side with the center. Our group is also comprised of student animators who wish to share a message through their pieces of art. <p> In early 2019, we began by conducting interviews on workers and listening to their stories to understand what was going on. We were utterly shocked by how they were treated by their employers and the work environment where they spent hours a day working constantly. Partnering with the Seongnam Migrants Center, we were given the opportunity on working on a project that raised awareness on this matter. We decided to make animated videos to inform the mistreatment multiple people are experiencing every day.</div>
