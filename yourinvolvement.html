				<h1> Legal Aspect of Project Hands-in-Action <p> <span style= color:gray;font-size:22px > <i> Simplified ver. </i> </span> </h1>

				<h1> Key Definitions </h1>
				<h3> According to the Labor Standards Act - Article II; <p>
				"Worker": a person, of any occupation, who offers work to a business or workplace for the purpose of earning wages; <p>
				"Employer" : a business owner, or one responsible for managing a business which acts on behalf of a business owner with respect to matters relating to workers; <p>
				"Work": both mental work and physical work; <p>

				According to the Occupational Safety and Health Act - Article II; <p>

				"Industrial accidents": the death, injury, or disease of employees caused by structures, equipment, raw materials, gas, vapor, powder, dust, etc., related to their duties, or by their work or other duties; <p>
				"Business owner": a person who operates a business by employing employees; <p>
				"Safety and health checkup": an investigation and evaluation conducted by a person designated by the Minister of Employment and Labor for preventing industrial accidents by discovering latent hazards and establishing countermeasures for their improvement; </h3> <p> 


				<h1> Violation </h1>
				<h2> A. WORKING CONDITIONS </h2>
				<h3> <i> Labor Standards Act - Article 50 (Work Hours) </i> <p>
				Work hours shall not exceed 40 hours a week and 8 hours a day, both excluding hours of recess.</h3>
				<h4> How was this violated? <p>
				Workers have reported that they worked 12-hour shifts with occasional 10 minute break. </h4>

				<p>
				<p>
				<h2> B. GOVERNMENT INSPECTIONS </h2>
				<h3> <i> Occupational Safety and Health Act - Article 4 </i> <p>
				The government shall fulfill the responsibilities of establishing and controlling occupational safety policies by guiding accident prevention in places of business. They must also regularly evaluate and improve the safety of dangerous machinery, protective devices, protective clothing, etc.   </h3>


				<h2> C. COMPENSATION </h2>
				<h3> <i> Labor Standards Act - Article 78 (Compensation for Medical Treatment)</i> <p>
				An employer shall provide necessary medical treatment at his/her expense or bear corresponding expenses for an employee who suffers from an occupational injury or disease. </h3>
				<h4> How was this violated? <p>
				Despite the employer(s) paying for the first medical attention the workers received, there were cases where they had to work after partial recovery to compensate their employer(s) for the expense they caused. </h4>

				<h3> <i> Labor Standards Act - Article 79 (Compensation for Suspension of Work)</i> <p>
				An employer shall pay an employee who is under medical treatment during which they are in suspension of work equivalent to 60 percent of his/her average wages. </h3>
				<h4> How was this violated? <p>
				The employer(s) provided their workers with little to no compensation for the first medical treatment, and left them to fund the rest of their medical attention from their own pockets.</h4>

				<h3> <i> Labor Standards Act - Article 80 (Compensation for Disability)</i> <p>
				If an employer suffers permanent disability after treatment, an employer is obligated to provide wages calculated by multiplying the average wages by the number of days as provided for in attached Table in accordance with the grade of disability. </h3>
				<h4> How was this violated? <p>
				Similarly to Article 79, the employer(s) provided little to no compensation for their workers' medical treatment, and told the workers they were obligated to pay for the rest of their medical attention at their own expense. </h4>

				<h2> D. FLAWS IN THE SYSTEM </h2>
				<h3> <i> Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act - Article 64 </i> <p>
				When a person entitled to a survivors' compensation annuity who is not a Korean national leaves Korea to live in a foreign country. </h3>
				<h4> How was this violated? <p>
				Employers are exploiting legal loopholes in this article by elongating their payment so that the workers have no choice but to move back to their country without receiving the full compensation. This was the case of one of the workers we interviewedâ€¦ his employer only provided him with certain sums of money every month and his stay eventually reached around 2 years. </h4>
